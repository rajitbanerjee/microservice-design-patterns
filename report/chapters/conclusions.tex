In this section you will sum up your report, draw some conclusions about your work so far, and make some
general observations about the work to come. You may also use this opportunity to express points of view,
or make factual claims, that are more pertinent here than in other sections of the report. If your project
raises some ethical concerns, for example about how data or users are treated, then address them here in a
thoughtful manner.

Regarding this document, here are some concluding points that you should keep in mind when writing your own.
You may use screenshots in your report, but do not overfill your report with them, or with figures of any kind.
Make sure that figures earn their keep, and are not just present as space fillers or as eye candy. If you use
diagrams or figures from other people's work, including the web, be sure to cite the creator in the corresponding
caption. All things being equal, it is better to construct your own figures than to copy and paste those of others.
In any case, always make sure that your images are readable, do not suffer from pixelation or aliasing effects,
and that each is clearly numbered, captioned and meaningfully referenced in the main body of the text.

Ensure that there is a cohesive argument expressed in the text of the report and that it is not simply a bag of
diagrams, screenshots and wishful thinking. Every report should tell a story, so know what story you want to tell.
When you include images, make sure they are readable and truly add to the discussion.

Make sure your language is professional throughout, and steer a course between pompous and colloquial. Maintain
authorial distance and do not overuse “me,” “I” and “our.” Your are writing for a professional audience who will
judge you on the quality of your prose, so use a grammar and a spelling checker.

Use LaTeX if you wish - this is recommended if you plan to use mathematical formulae in your report, but in any
case, keep the general spacing and font/style you find here (Single or 1.5 spacing, 12 pt. font for text, etc.).
Be sure to submit a PDF (never a .DOC or .DOCX file) as your report. If you prepare your report in MS Word, as
this document has been, save it as a PDF before you submit it. Overall it should be about 18 - 20 pages, including
figures, front matter and references, A significant portion of the report will be textual, with approx.. five or
six thousand words. Do not rely on images or other filler to write your report for you.
The dates and means of submission will be communicated to you separately.
