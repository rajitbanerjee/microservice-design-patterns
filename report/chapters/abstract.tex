\chapter*{Abstract}

Performance engineering is an integral part of the software design lifecycle for microservice-based systems, especially with the growing importance of microservices in modern-day system design. When developing new microservices or refactoring monolithic applications into several services, design patterns and anti-patterns play an important role in providing guidance regarding documented good and bad practices in a given context. Performance analysis of such patterns is essential as they can greatly impact user experience and overall system performance. In this project, case studies are conducted to implement and evaluate a number of common design patterns in microservice-based web applications. Performance modelling, API functional testing, and systematic performance testing to measure response times are used in the evaluation process for case studies.
