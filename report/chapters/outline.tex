\chapter{Outline of Approach}

In this section present an outline of your considered approach to the problem at the centre of your project. Clearly present your design choices, or your choice of algorithms, and any pertinent model parameters. For instance, if you plan to use a genetic algorithm, outline here a sense of your fitness function, major variables, population size, and so on, so that your reviewers can critique your choices. If you opt for a neural architecture, describe your chosen framework, and motivate the number and kinds of layers in your network. In short, be specific about the choices you are committing to at this stage. Being vague and non-specific will not help your case, as your report will be graded in large part on the specificity and perceived wisdom of your choices. Remember also that feedback is intended to help you as you progress to the next stage of your project. If you give reviewers little to chew on, they will not be able to give you specific feedback and guidance.
