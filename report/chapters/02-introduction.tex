\chapter{Introduction}

Introduce your vision of the project here. Describe the domain of the project, and the intended application. A well-written report will answer three key questions: What am I doing in this project? Why is it worth doing? How do I plan to go about it? In this introductory section, offer a concise answer to the What, and follow-up with a compelling account of the Why. Leave the How to a subsequent section. Do not try to do too much in any single section of the report. By providing details in a logical order, you will show that you have a plan for the report and the project.
