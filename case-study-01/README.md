# Case Study 1

The first case study showcasing a web app built (movie ticket reservation system) to demonstrate microservice design patterns.

- Starting the services with Docker Compose:

```bash
./run-services.sh --clean
```

- For local testing of the backend API, run the requests in `.http` files under `./api-gateway-service/src/main/resources/http/*`.
